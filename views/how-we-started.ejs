        <p class="verbose">Jerry and Joe Divine Foundation (JJDF) was  founded in September, 2008, and registered in the state of Texas in the United States as a non-governmental charitable organization and in memory of two heroes of faith-Venerable Jeremiah Udeogwu Anyiwo - an Anglican priest and Sir Joseph Belonwu Nwokolo-Knight of St John(KSJ) a devout catholic  who have passed to the great beyond in 1987 and 2001 respectively. They have worked tirelessly during their life time to help people in need. There is no better way of immortalizing them than to continue their legacy. <a id="read-more-started" href="#read-more-started">Read more &raquo;</a></p>

        <p class="verbose extra-started">The conception and birth of JJDF, as a child of necessity, was the effort of the children of these heroes of faith: Prof. Clement Anyiwo and Mrs. Ifeoma Christiana Nwokolo-Anyiwo. The focus is to help vulnerable children and children orphaned by HIV/AIDS or natural disaster with material assistance, educational and psychological support. We plan to empower widows to sustainable self-development and treat those debilitated by diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and diabetes. Our guiding philosophy is to “give a man food, you have fed him today, but teach him how to farm, you have fed him for a life time” </p>

        <p class="verbose extra-started">Motivation to launch the Jerry and Joe Divine Foundation came out of sympathy after the founders-Prof and Mrs. Anyiwo witnessed misery and hardship experienced by deprived children who roam the streets due to poverty and lack of care because their parents are either too poor to take care of them or deceased due to debilitating illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis or Diabetes. This experience was after travelling to many countries of the world for 20 years particularly of Africa on assignment, conferences or vacation. We seek to ensure that these children who have lost their parents should not lose their childhood. They could well be the hope for our future.</p>

        <p class="verbose extra-started">JJDF is operated by a Board of Directors and officers who are drawn from Africa, Europe and the United States.  The target countries for operation at present are United States, Malawi, Tanzania and Nigeria.</p>
